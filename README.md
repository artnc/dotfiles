# dotfiles

Here are some of my software settings.

The `./install.sh` script symlinks these config files to their expected locations, e.g. `~/.zshrc`. New [codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-your-user-preferences/personalizing-github-codespaces-for-your-account#dotfiles) call this script automatically. Running it with `DRY_RUN=1` will show a preview of the changes without performing them.
