In all programming languages:

- Always use 2-space indentation unless stated otherwise.
- Always sort literal dictionary keys and interface members alphabetically.
- Avoid single-use local variables; prefer to inline them instead.

In TypeScript and JavaScript source code:

- Always use arrow functions instead of the `function` keyword.
- Always use spread syntax instead of `Array.from`.
- Prefer Makefile targets instead of npm scripts.

In Python source code:

- Always use 4-space indentation.
- Always use `re.search` instead of `re.match`.

In C# source code:

- Always use K&R-style braces instead of Allman-style braces.

In Makefile source code:

- Always place each `.PHONY` label directly above its corresponding target instead of collecting them all into a single `.PHONY` statement at the top of the file.
