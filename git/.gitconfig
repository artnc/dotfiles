# I previously declared user.name and user.email in this ~/.gitconfig, but that
# has a few disadvantages: it couples this config to my own identity despite
# this config's availability in my public dotfiles repo for others to use, it
# makes my email addresses publicly scrapable from that repo, and it locks me
# into a single user.email regardless of what repo I'm committing in. So now I
# instead use Git's GIT_CONFIG_COUNT/GIT_CONFIG_KEY_0/GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_0/etc
# env vars to set these values dynamically at commit time
