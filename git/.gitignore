# I almost always run Node.js stuff inside Docker, I still install NPM packages
# locally so that Sublime Text's LSP-typescript plugin can find definitions,
# I'm currently of the opinion that gitignores for files used by unenforced
# developer tools (e.g. Sublime Text (which is usually optional in all repos)
# as opposed to Android Studio (which is usually required in Android repos))
# should be declared by the developer rather than by the repo, and I don't want
# the maintenance hassle of declaring node_modules in all my Node
# repos' .git/info/exclude files. Due to all those facts, I declare
# node_modules here in this global .gitignore file that I set as the value of
# Git's core.excludesfile config option.
#
# An alternative strategy that I previously experimented with was installing all
# repos' required definitions into a single ~/node_modules directory and
# relying on TypeScript's module resolution to find them by recursively
# searching upward through the file system. This was slightly more convenient
# than installing each project's required NPM packages separately but had the
# minor disadvantage of exposing my list of packages (via the ~/package.json
# checked into my public dotfiles repo) and the major disadvantage of globally
# supporting only one version per package.
