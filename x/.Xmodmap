! Remap Caps Lock to Windows key

! @artnc: On 2024-10-19, I had to change Hyper_L to Super_L to fix this error:
!
!   $ xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap
!   X Error of failed request:  BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)
!     Major opcode of failed request:  118 (X_SetModifierMapping)
!     Value in failed request:  0x17
!     Serial number of failed request:  13
!     Current serial number in output stream:  13
!
! I guessed Super_L from the output of `xmodmap -pm`.
clear Lock
keycode 66 = Super_L
add mod4 = Super_L
